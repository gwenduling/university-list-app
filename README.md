Still reading this? Awesome!

Hello, I am [Gwe](https://gwenduling.com)! This is actually a technical exam I needed to do for an awesome company. And it is my first time to work on React! Not out of strong opinions against it but because I didn't have the time.

Anyway I am glad I pushed myself to continue this exam because I was prolonging it for a month now. It is fun learning React. I find it as both similar and an opposite of Angular ü§™. There's still a lot of areas to learn, I know I have just encountered a tiny bit the last few days, specially about best practices. Here's to kickstarting the 2021 with something new üçª!
